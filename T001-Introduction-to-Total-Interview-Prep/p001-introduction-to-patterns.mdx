# Introduction to Total Interview Prep

Welcome to Make Schools total interview prep course. 

We call this "total" interview prep because it incorporates a wholistic approach to technical job interviewing and preperation.

**Components of total interview prep:**
* Setting goals and creating a pathway to achieve them 🌅
* Managing mental health and spirtual wellness during the interview grind 🧘
* Mastering interview stratedgies and the knowledge to ace them 💯
* Understanding algorithms and the programming language tricks needed to code them 🤔
* Building an interview pipeline and keeping it flowing 🚰

Activites in this course have been sprinkled throughout the Make School courses so some of the questions may look familiar!

Students can use this course as a way to keep track of all the interview prep they've learned while at Make School and aslo as a guide for independent study

**Course Structure:**

Each topic concept has been broken down into the following bite-sized chunck forumla:

1. An introduction to the concept 👋
- Learning outcomes and what to expect with each concept get listed here
- Each introduction will list the prerequisite materials and links to the previous needed topics if you ever need a refresher! 🧠
2. Video and text learning materials paired with LeetCode questions to build understanding 🧑‍🏫 👩‍🏫
- You can choose to start with the video, or jump straight into the LeetCode question and use the video if you need help.
- Written materials should be used to solidify the learning and also act as a quick reference if you need to relearn a code snippet.
3. An in-depth coding activity that takes the material and implements it into a production coding environment for mastery 💪
- These activites operate open-ended (just like a real interview would 💦) and fully interpreting the problem is part of the process!
- Multiple optimal solutions may exist, but the activity will can always be solved using the relevant optimal solution from the previous lesson.
