**Course Structure:**

Each topic concept has been broken down into the following bite-sized chunck forumla:

1. An introduction to the concept 👋
- Learning outcomes and what to expect with each concept get listed here
- Each introduction will list the prerequisite materials and links to the previous needed topics if you ever need a refresher! 🧠
2. Video and text learning materials paired with LeetCode questions to build understanding 🧑‍🏫 👩‍🏫
- You can choose to start with the video, or jump straight into the LeetCode question and use the video if you need help.
- Written materials should be used to solidify the learning and also act as a quick reference if you need to relearn a code snippet.
3. An in-depth coding activity that takes the material and implements it into a production coding environment for mastery 💪
- These activites operate open-ended (just like a real interview would 💦) and fully interpreting the problem is part of the process!
- Multiple optimal solutions may exist, but the activity will can always be solved using the relevant optimal solution from the previous lesson.
